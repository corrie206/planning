# Hello folks.

In order to get the momentum going for our next meetup, I thought I'd start our thread as early as possible.

A lot of ideas have been discussed, but we should probably try implementing as many as possible without letting our awesome meetup stop.

A personal thank you to Tobie for setting up our static group site.

See these links for the github repos and the site itself:

# The event:

Our next event will be hosted on 17 May 2014 (Saturday) at our default venue: H4H in Lyttleton. (Both the date and venue are subject to change, based on feedback)

We will try to start a bit early, say around 1.30pm (pending confirmation from Schalk about any events before ours).

10 May is booked by the Arduino guys, so 17 May would be the next best date to host the event.

With regards to the venue, if anybody would like to recommend another place to host it (meaning that we rotate venues), please come forward with suggestions. Anywhere in between Centurion and Midrand is welcome. Please keep in mind that we will need access to a projector, wall-plugs, WiFi and any other relevant equipment concerning running our laptops.


# Confirming attendance:

There was some discussion concerning using meetup.com. There hasn't been much discussion further concerning this. Also, I don't think most of you would like to refill my Google form again, which is why I was thinking we could attempt a static confirmation using our github repo.

What I will do is create a static page with everyones names on it and you can just fork the repo, confirm your attendance and send us a pull request (if you are unsure how to use github, please see info below concerning it).

Share your feedback on this idea for confirming your attendance, as it seems like a convenient way for us to centralize everything through github (hosting, blogs, etc.)

# Talks:

Tobie has created a list of talks in one of the repos. There are plenty topics, so please come forward with whatever knowledge you have and would like to share.

I will be presenting 2 talks (hopefully) combined into 1. The first talk will largely involve info I post on our repo concerning a tool called: pythonbrew . I found that having the right version of python with all dependencies (and a venv) was important to getting our stuff to work. Also, I'm sure many of you don't want to break your system python versions, which is what pythonbrew can protect. I will post instructions linking to it and how to install it (and create a venv within each python version). By combining the pythonbrew aspect, I will then present "using a visual web-scraper" made by the guys from Scraping Hub. Don't worry about the idea of me presenting 2 talks, as I will keep it as short as possible (a lot of pre-work and info will be shared on our webpage and I'm targeting a talk of around 30 minutes). The web scraping topic will be dependent on how far I get with the software personally. However, I will be tinkering with it during this week, so I should have something ready by 17 May.

# Other matters:

I firstly would like to apologize for being a bit lazy and not writing a blog post (long weekend :'D). All things I've discussed since the end of our first meetup and I planned to put up, will be done over the next couple of days (blog post, instructions for pythonbrew, static attendance form, etc.)

To all of you that need help with Git and GitHub, please contact myself or Tobie (if he is available) and we will assist you with everything. If you know how to use git/github, just send Tobie an email with your username and he will add you to our "organization" (as classified by github).

We've also come up with a creative solution to grow attendance organically. I think it was Walter who mentioned that we should introduce a "bring a friend" offer to all attendees. So basically, if you are coming and know someone who'd like to learn stuff about python, you'd bring them along.

<!-- end -->

I hope I've gotten all the necessary info written down in this post.

All feedback appreciated and welcome.

Regards,
